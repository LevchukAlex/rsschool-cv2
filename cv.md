## Briefly About Myself:
_I started my career working as a low-voltage network designer, while working as an English teacher for kids._

_After a year of work in the design department, it became clear that I do not really like what I do. I changed my direction of work. But I didnâ€™t give up teaching with children. I became an administrator of the site and organizing online events. There was quite a lot of time for self-education and the frontend attracted my attention. At first it was not clear what it was, but the further I delved into the study of various materials on this topic, the more I realized that I wanted to know more and be able to work with it._

_When I was in school, I also studied at an art school, which helped a lot to develop many of the skills that I still use. In my free time, I enjoy doing design and painting._

_Working with children taught me patience and perseverance, so it helps a lot in studying interesting and necessary material._

_During my studies at the university, I was the head of the student council. It was a fun time in which I learned how to solve difficult problems. I am good at finding a common language with people._

_English is my second native language, because I spent my childhood in New York. It is very easy for me to talk and use foreign literature to study materials._

_I believe that my ability to learn and acquire new skills will help me learn everything it takes to become a frontend developer._
